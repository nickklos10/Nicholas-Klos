# Nicholas Klos - Personal Portfolio

## Overview
This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website. The website showcases my professional background, education, experience, and projects. It also includes a contact form for inquiries.

The portfolio is built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Node.js for handling form submissions. It features a dynamic and responsive design to highlight my skills, certifications, and projects in a user-friendly way.

## Key Features:
- `Responsive Design`: The website is fully responsive, providing a seamless experience across devices.
- `Interactive Projects Section`: Clickable project cards that open a modal with detailed descriptions.
- `Contact Form`: Users can send messages directly through the website using the form, powered by Node.js and Nodemailer.
- `Education and Experience Sections`: Structured sections that highlight my academic achievements and work experience.

## Technologies Used

Frontend:
- HTML5
- CSS3 (including Boxicons for icons)

## Usage
1. `Portfolio Homepage`
This is the landing page, providing an introduction to me as a software engineer. You will find links to other sections of the portfolio such as Education, Projects, and Contact.

2. `Projects Page`
The projects page displays a list of the major projects I've worked on. Each project is presented as a card. Clicking on a card opens a modal with more information about the project, including the technologies used and a link to the source code.

3. `Contact Form`
The contact page allows users to send me messages directly via a form. The form submits the data to the Node.js server, which uses Nodemailer to send the email to my Gmail account. Upon successful submission, users are redirected to a confirmation page.
